# OpenAi-spring-react-app

## Overview

SpringAI-Chat-Recipe-Image is a full-stack web application that demonstrates how to integrate Spring AI (for OpenAI APIs) with a modern React frontend. It offers three AI-powered features: a chat interface for natural language Q&A, a recipe generator that creates cooking recipes from user prompts, using prompt teamplaten, and an image generator that creates images from text descriptions.The backend is built with Spring Boot (providing a scalable, production-ready API layer) and uses the Spring AI library for seamless OpenAI integration. The frontend is built with React.js + Vite, delivering a responsive and interactive user interface. 
 This README follows best practices by including a project overview, setup instructions, API documentation, and a roadmap




## Features

- **AI Chat Interface**: Real-time conversational chat powered by OpenAI’s language models. Users can send a message and receive a natural-language response from the AI
- **Recipe Generator**: Generates personalized recipes based on user  ingredients, cuisine and dietaryRestrictions. Users enter the informations, and the AI returns a complete recipe tailored to those inputs
- **Image Generator**: Creates AI-generated images from text prompts. Users describe a scene or concept, and the app returns an image generated by OpenAI
